# RBE 550 - Basic Search Algorithms Implementation

## Overview

In this assignment, you are going to implement **BFS** and **DFS** algorithms with Python 3. This template is provided to you as a starting point. After you finish coding, you would be able to create your own map to test different algorithms, and visualize the path found by them.

Files included:

- **search.py** Implement algorithms. 
- **main.py** Helper functions that load the map from csv files and visualize the map and path.
- **map.csv** is the map file you could modify to create your own map.
- **test_map.csv** restores a test map for doc test purpose only
